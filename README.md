## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently working as a research and development engneer from Tokyo/Japan in artificial intelligence, 
especially applied deep learning.

Also, I majored in condensed matter physics when I was a master's student and love it.
I'm interested in applied mathmatics and it's inpact on real-world as well as basic technologies as a engneer such as WEB.
